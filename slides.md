For those who might be new to OpenTelemetry, let me give you a quick overview.

[click] OpenTelemetry is a framework for generating, processing, and exporting telemetry data.
It provides a unified approach to observability across different signals such as

[click] traces

[click] metrics

[click] logs

[click] profiles

[click] The beauty of OpenTelemetry is that it gives you one standard way to instrument your applications, regardless of the language or backend you're using.
Whether you're sending data to Jaeger, Prometheus, Splunk, or any other observability platform, OpenTelemetry provides the common foundation.

Why the distinction?

Because not every log your application emits deserves to be treated like something meaningful.

<!--

Jeremy Morrell wrote a nice blog post called "A Practitioner's Guide to Wide Events" that basically says: "What if we just logged everything we need in really rich, wide events?"

The idea is simple but powerful: instead of having traces, metrics, and logs as separate things, you emit super-detailed events that contain ALL the context you need.
Then you can derive spans and metrics from these logs with proper semantics.

Think about it:
- Want a span?
  Extract the start/end timestamps and duration from your events.
  Follow the correlation IDs and build the trace graph.
- Need metrics?
  Aggregate the numerical values in your event attributes.

[click]
Now, I have to admit something: I was actually doing this back in 2019.
Not because I was some visionary genius, but because I only had access to an efficient logs backend.
When you're stuck with one tool, you get creative.

[click]
Of course, there are huge trade-offs of such approach.
Additional storage costs, processing overhead on the backend, bigger network traffic, not mentioning the existential crisis of "am I doing observability wrong?"

[click]
But when it works, it's like having X-ray vision into your systems.
Everything is connected, everything has context, and you can slice and dice your data however you want without wondering if you forgot to add that one crucial attribute to your metric.

However, always remember, there is no silver bullet.

You can read about it more online.

Because what good is amazing structured logging if it kills your application's performance?

OpenTelemetry recently added an Enabled API.
It is a way to check if logging is actually needed before you do all the expensive work of building log records.
Think of it as "measure twice, cut once" but for telemetry.

The idea is simple: before you spend CPU cycles formatting messages, serializing complex objects, or building those beautiful structured attributes, you ask: "Hey, is anyone actually going to process this log?"
If the answer is no, you skip all the work.

What did we learn today?
Let me summarize this journey through the chaotic world of logs.

We've all been writing trash logs. "LOGGING HERE" with dashes?
We've ALL been there. But trash logs cost money, slow down apps, and make observability engineers cry into their coffee.

In OpenTelemetry, logs are structured and can contain complex data.
Moreover, complex attributes are going to also arrive to other signals.
OpenTelemetry has semantic conventions that not only define the attributes, but also distinguish between log and event records.
Logs are getting faster too.

That's the kind of evolution that should make everyone happy: developers get better observability, operations get cleaner data.
